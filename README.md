# file-name-updating
 This is a small python program that helps someone to update or correct errors in names of files in a certain directory.
 
 Example: Changing (emptyspaces and - into underscores)
  If the initial file name was "Crying-baby picture.png", the updated name will be "Crying_baby_picture.png".
  
  This program can help someone to rename all their files in a standard format. This in return helps one to avoid the unnecesary risks and errors accompanied with linking these files to their code.
